## Memora
First attempt at MVVM toolkit, as well as a proper program which utilises API requests to an API created beforehand.
The goal is to implement a persistant application, wher users can revise their studies with the help of flashcards.

# Possible features:
- revising flashcards by flipping between the front and the back,
- possibility to type in the desired answer,
- shuffling/randomizing flashcards order,
- group flashcard sets in various folders,
- review the results based on one/many study sesisons.
